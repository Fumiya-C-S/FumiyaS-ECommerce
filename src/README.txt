Application Description:
My application is an e-commerce platform that takes from a dummy-json and lists all products that are purchasable. Users can add items to the cart,
edit quantity of items, and delete items from the shopping list. Users can also search for products based on the title of the item or its category. 
Users can see ratings, a picture of the item, and it's price in the list of items, and in the shopping cart, they can see the quantity of the item
they are trying to purchase, as well as the total at the bottom. The website all operates on one page, making it easier for users to naviagte 
and shop while looking at what is in their shopping cart already.
